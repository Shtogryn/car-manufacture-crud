**Preconditions:**

2. Run "docker-compose up" cli command from spring-boot-basics directory.
3. Analyze database schema, identify relationship.

**Tasks:**

1. Design & implement "Car" CRUD REST interface based on prepared infrastructure.
2. Cover the most important pieces by unit tests
   (it is allowed to use third party dependencies).
3. Design & implement REST endpoint which takes brand name and returns the list of engineers' names who are responsible for given

- delete all containers: docker rm -vf $(docker ps -a -q)
